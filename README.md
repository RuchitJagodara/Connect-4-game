# Connect-4-game

Implemented the connect 4 game using the DFS algorithm for graph traversal, which goes through every possible permutations of the moves and then it finds the best possible move for that particular situation of board. And with the help of memoization it stores the best move for every node which it has visited (here node mean the situation of the board).
